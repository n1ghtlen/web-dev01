            <!--informative paragraph about history of movement-->
            <p>
                Symbolism was an artistic movement most prominent in the late 19th century.
                The style is based on a dreamy, fantastical take of reality and was unsurprisingly
                a reaction to realism eras like Impressionism.
                Like the name suggests, symbols are often used to portay the inner world of
                the subject or the artist.
