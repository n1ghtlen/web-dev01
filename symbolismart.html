            <h2>History of Symbolism</h2>

            <!--informative paragraph about history of movement-->
            <p>
                Symbolism was an artistic movement most prominent in the late 19th century in France.
                The style is based on a dreamy, fantastical take of reality and was unsurprisingly
                the antithesis to realism eras like Impressionism.
                Like the name suggests, symbols are often used to portay the inner world of
                the subject or the artist.
            </p>
                <p>
                    Objective reality does not exist in these pieces, but rather an emotional reaction
                    to industrialism and its changing impact on society. Not only painters, but also poets
                    and other literary artists expressed their innermost feelings.
                </p>
                    <p>
                        Pieces often express the idea that there is more beyond that which is physical,
                        and there is a story to be told in the context of the spiritual world and figures
                        that represent that world.
                    </p>

                <p><b>Gustav Klimt</b></p>
                <p>
                    Born in the Austrian Empire in 1862, Klimt was known for his symbolist works,
                    many portraying the female body. He became successful towards the very
                    beginning of the 20th century. He passed in 1918, but his remaining
                    paintings have been auctioned off for tens of millions of dollars. One had
                    even surpassed the selling price of one of Picasso's pieces at the time.

                <p><b>Edvard Munch</b></p>
                <p>
                    Even if you don't know Munch by name, you probably have seen his painting
                    titled "The Scream" picturing a figure with their hands laid flat over their
                    ears. Munch was born in Norway in 1863, and derived more of his artistic expression
                    from his personal struggles than that of other famous Symbolism artists at the time.
                    He followed the philosophy of "I do not believe in the art which is not the compulsive
                    result of Man's urge to open his heart."

                <p><b>Gustave Moreau</b></p>
                <p>
                    Moreau was born in 1826 in Paris, France. He's widely considered the forerunner
                    of Symbolism that helped the movement gain traction. His pieces mainly surround
                    mythological and religious subjects. The subject matter was often two figures
                    locking eyes, usually a man and a woman. His paintings were very elegant and
                    divine in nature.
